This directory contains all plugins to be treated by proxenet. 
To be executed, a script must:
- be in a language supported by proxenet (C, Python, ...);
- have a name using this structure: <priority><name>.<ext> where:
  priority is an integer (1: high priority, 9: low priority). ex:
    * 900MyScript.foo -> prio:9, name:00MyScript, ext:foo

Priority corresponds to the place the plugin will be inserted in the plugin
list. proxenet scheduler won't make any difference between plugins running with
a same level of priority.

Example scripts have been provided in this directory and can be used as helpers.
